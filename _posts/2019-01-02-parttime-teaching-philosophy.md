Throughout my teaching career, I have worked in departments with strong policies to maintain course quality and consistency. These departments often assign course coordinators who provide learning outcomes, syllabi, and lecture materials. I collaborate closely with these coordinators to adapt content when necessary, ensuring that materials align both with institutional standards and my personal teaching philosophy. The support of fellow faculty and department leadership has been instrumental in creating a collaborative and student-focused teaching environment.

Teaching Experience
==========

My first university-level teaching experience was as an instructor for Calculus I, an opportunity that helped me appreciate the three pillars of effective teaching: preparation, lecturing, and assessment. Following positive student feedback, I was invited to teach Calculus II the following semester.

Between 2017 and 2025, I consistently taught undergraduate or graduate courses in most semesters while balancing my teaching responsibilities with a full-time position in industry. This experience has deepened my understanding of how students learn and how to adapt instruction to their needs. Some key examples include:

* CS 1301 – Programming Principles I:
This gateway course often included freshmen and non-CS majors, with historically high DFWI (Drop, Fail, Withdraw, Incomplete) rates. I began each class by emphasizing the real-world relevance of programming and showcasing industry applications. This approach helped improve student engagement, reduce failure rates, and inspire many students to pursue internships.

* CS 7263 – Text Mining:
This graduate course attracted both full-time students with limited industry experience and part-time professionals seeking practical exposure. To meet their varied needs, I implemented a flexible assessment structure—short, frequent quizzes for steady progress and a major project for hands-on learning. This balance allowed students to remain engaged while gaining experience with industry-relevant projects.

Teaching Approach
==========

My goal as a teacher is to transfer enthusiasm for the subject while fostering independent, critical thinking. I build strong relationships with students by encouraging participation and offering flexible office hours. These efforts consistently lead to positive student feedback and above-average outcomes.

I believe effective teaching balances guidance with independence—helping students explore concepts while providing mentorship that keeps them focused and motivated. I emphasize problem-solving over rote learning, guiding students to develop their own reasoning rather than simply supplying solutions. Ultimately, good teaching invests in students’ intellectual growth and prepares them for lifelong learning and contribution.

Professional Development in Teaching
==========

Teaching part-time is not a secondary pursuit for me—it is a serious professional commitment. I continuously seek feedback and participate in faculty development opportunities to refine my instructional methods.

* CETL Online Course Development Workshop (Jan 2018):
Learned strategies to engage students in scalable online environments through one-to-many interaction models.

* SPACE Symposium for Part-time, Adjunct, and Contingent Educators (June 2019):
Presented on balancing full-time industry work with part-time teaching and exchanged insights with fellow educators.

* Gateway Course Experience Conference (March 2019):
Gained valuable perspectives on teaching large-enrollment “gateway” courses, which influenced my classroom design and delivery.

Teaching as a Rewarding Experience
==========

I take pride in the positive evaluations and feedback I receive, which I attribute to empathy, responsiveness, and consistent engagement. I make myself available during crucial academic moments—such as final grading periods—to support students and address their concerns promptly.

Watching students grow, gain confidence, and succeed—both academically and professionally—is deeply rewarding. For me, teaching is more than delivering content; it is about inspiring curiosity, nurturing potential, and contributing to the next generation of thinkers and innovators.
