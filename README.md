	My primary research area of interest lies in software engineering. I have worked in many interdisciplinary projects involving software engineering and 
	several fields (e.g., High-Performance computing, Machine learning, Data mining, Mathematics, Cloud computing) to improve design, development, and maintenance of software.
	I carefully 1) analyzed existing tool support 2) proposed new solutions, and 3) determined advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach compared to the existing 
	tools in the relevant area. 


<br/>
<br/>

My Ph.D dissertation is based on applying software modeling techniques to computation intensive problems for heterogeneous computing and improved source code maintenance. 
	I was supported by a grant from Air Force/AFRL STTR, which I helped Dr. Jeff Gray in preparing and submitting. Much of the work for this grant is part of my Ph.D. thesis.
Based on our performance in Phase I, we were invited to submit proposal for Phase II. I completed my Master's thesis on providing tool support for software code clones.
