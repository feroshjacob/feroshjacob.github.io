Two key factors determine the effectiveness of any document search:

How well we understand the input queries, and

How effectively the underlying data is organized.

In this talk, I demonstrate how an ontology can be leveraged to enhance both query understanding and data organization. While ontologies provide powerful benefits, their creation and maintenance can be challenging. I discuss the practical difficulties, lessons learned, and key assumptions encountered while developing an ontology tailored to the home improvement and retail domain.
