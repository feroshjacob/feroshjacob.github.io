Most students who enroll in computer science courses aspire to pursue careers in software development. As a software engineer myself, I strive to help them understand core concepts through an application-oriented perspective.

In this session, I share my experience teaching CS 1301, an introductory course on Java programming that was considered a gateway course with a historically high DFWI (Drop, Fail, Withdraw, Incomplete) rate. For many students, this was their first exposure to programming, and many approached it with anxiety and self-doubt about their ability to succeed.

The talk highlights the strategies I developed to engage students, sustain their focus, build confidence, and spark genuine curiosity and excitement about programming. These approaches draw heavily on my 15 years of professional experience as a software engineer, translating real-world insights into classroom practices that make learning programming both accessible and inspiring.
