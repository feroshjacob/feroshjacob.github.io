In the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), several reliable open-source tools and libraries are implemented in Java. At The Home Depot, many projects leverage these Java-based frameworks to implement state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that drive innovation across retail and home improvement domains.

This talk provides an overview of several such projects, highlighting their motivation, design, and business impact. The session also features a live demonstration showing how to build and deploy a machine learningâ€“based solution for a real-world problem in the home improvement and retail space.
