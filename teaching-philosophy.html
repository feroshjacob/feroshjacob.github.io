<p>I consider teaching both a challenging and exciting profession.
Technically, teaching can be defined as a three-step cyclic process. To
start with, a teacher is given a subject and a few students. In the
first step, he or she has to do the background reading and get excited
about the topic. In the second step, he or she should reach their
students and pass the excitement to them. In the third step, the
students go out, increase their knowledge base, and pass it back to
their teacher. The teacher updates his or her knowledge base and
prepares for a new set of students. The final contribution of the
student, which is very significant to the world, is heavily dependent on
the teacher’s first two steps. It is often hard, but not impossible, to
get excited about a topic and pass it to the students. My approach to
achieve this formidable task is made up of two questions.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-teach">What to teach?</h4>
<p>As an instructor, I like to focus on the fundamentals rather than the
overlying transient technologies. I have to identify the high-level
goals of a course. As an example, a student who has completed a course
on compiler construction with me should have: 1) the curiosity to check
out the grammar and the optimizations applied in Java, even though in
class we discussed Pascal; 2) the confidence in implementing an
algorithm in any language if the grammar of that language is provided;
and 3) the ability to see programming languages as tools of
implementation. After identifying these high-level goals, I will
distribute my teaching material in such a way that I can introduce these
goals to my students in an orderly fashion and keeping the high-level
picture clear.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-teach">How to teach?</h4>
<p>This is another difficult question to answer as it has no fixed
answer. Teaching methods should vary based on the students, course, and
surroundings. As an example, to deal with struggling students and bored
students, assignments and tests should include both basic and
challenging questions, but their distribution can vary for different
classes. I believe, even for the same course, if the teacher has not
been forced to change his or her teaching methods from the first class
to the last class, he or she would be either very lucky or have failed
to understand his or her students. A teacher should make a very sincere
effort at self-evaluation after every class so that he or she can make
changes to teaching style. For each specific course, based on the
students, course, and surroundings the teaching methods have to evolve
with the mutual agreement of the students and the teacher.</p>

id="teaching-philosophy-of-a-part-time-faculty">Teaching philosophy of a
part-time faculty</h3>
<p>The computer science and the software engineering departments have
very strong policies to keep the standard of the courses on check. There
are course coordinators assigned by the department for all the courses I
taught. The course materials are prepared by the course coordinators
which include learning outcomes, syllabus, and even lecture slides. I
work with the course coordinator through out the course. We have
together even made changes in some cases if necessary. This completely
align with my teaching philosophy. This couldn’t have been possible with
the support from the faculty and the department chair.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="teaching-experience">Teaching Experience</h3>
<p>My first teaching experience at a university level came when I was
selected as an instructor for the Calculus-I course at Clarkson
University. It was an opportunity for me to get acquainted with the
three main aspects of classroom lecturing: 1) preparation before the
lecture, 2) lecturing, and 3) student assessment. Based on my student
reviews, I was assigned as an instructor for Calculus-II the next
semester.</p>
<p>Because of my genuine interest in teaching, I found time to teach
under-graduate and graduate level evening classes at KSU since summer
2017 (I am currently working as a full-time software professional). The
key component in teaching is to understand the students and realize how
they learn. The last few years at KSU has helped to understand the
student population at KSU specifically, the Computer Science (CS) and
Software Engineering (SWE) students . Please find below a quick summary
of my experiences of teaching two computer science courses at KSU:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>CS 1301 Programming Principles I:</em> This course had many
fresh-men students and many non-CS major students. Moreover, this course
was marked as a gateway course (high enrollment courses with a D, F, W,
I rate of 20% or more). I started my first lecture showing the average
salary of software engineers in Atlanta and used the opportunity to talk
about how important and fun is the programming in general. My industry
experience helped me to explain several concepts in the context of
industry applications and that made my lectures interesting and exciting
for the students. I take pride in reducing the D, F, W, I rate of the CS
1301 (Fall 2017) and I had many students interview for the summer
internship programs at The Home Depot.</p></li>
<li><p><em>CS 7263 Text Mining:</em> This is a graduate level course
with students that can be mainly categorized into two different groups:
1) Full-time students and 2) Part-time students. Many full-time students
had limited industry working experience and part-time students were
looking for a light course to complete the degree requirement. To
accommodate the two diverse groups, I modified the assessment methods
(after discussing with the course coordinator) to include a main project
and several quizzes, Short (5-10 questions to be completed in 10-15
minutes) but frequent quizzes were found very effective in the course.
Quizzes made sure the part-time students stay track with the course and
the final project helped the full-time students to work with the
part-time students to work on projects of industry standards.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout my teaching, I worked towards transferring my level of
interest and excitement about the topic to my students. I created a
strong student-teacher relationship with my students by encouraging
active class participation and providing flexible office hours. I was
successful in producing above average results for my class and
maintaining a very good relationship with my students.</p>
<p>From my experience in closely working with professors, I understand
that guidance is very important for the overall development of a
student. It can help the student to stay focused and transform him or
her into a responsible contributor to society. This should be achieved
without affecting the personal freedom of a student. A good teacher
should always trust and encourage his or her students in expressing
their views. Hence, a balance is required between the guidance of the
teacher and freedom of the student. I believe this can be achieved by
closely working with the students in the beginning to build a foundation
and then allow them to explore the concepts. A teacher should show how
to approach a problem rather than asking to solve the problem or giving
the solution. As a teacher, I understand and agree that my biggest
investments are my students. Teaching is one of the few professions in
which you grow by helping others to grow. I believe, as observed by many
senior professors, focus should be on students rather than their
research because good research cannot guarantee good students but good
students guarantee good research.</p>

relating trainings</h3>
<p>Teaching part-time at Kennesaw State University is not just a second
income for me. I consider my teaching very seriously and I always
listened to my students feedback and explored options to improve and
learn new techniques of teaching. Please find below some of the teacher
trainings I attended in the last five years and my experience attending
such trainings.</p>
<h4 id="cetl-online-course-development-workshop-january-2018">CETL
Online Course Development workshop, January 2018: </h4>
<p>This was my first course development workshop and we had several
group sessions and discussions on course development and teaching in
general. In one such discussions, I asked Dr. Esther Jordan, “Is it OK
start a lecture by asking an open-ended question to the class?”. Dr.
Jordan’s answer was never to get on a 1-1 interaction with any student
during the lecture. Dr. Jordan gave me several examples of 1-many
interactions that can replace the 1-1 interaction and achieve the same
goal. I found the workshop very useful as I continued to teach at
KSU.</p>
<h4
id="symposium-for-part-time-adjunct-and-contingent-educators-space-june-2019">Symposium
for Part-time, Adjunct, and Contingent Educators (SPACE), June 2019:
</h4>
<p>I met Mandy McGrew from CETL during the CETL workshop sessions. Ms.
McGrew introduced me to SPACE symposium and I gave a talk on “Full-time
software engineer and Part-time Instructor”. In the presentation, I
covered how much I enjoy teaching and how I find the balance between my
full time and part-time work. I also got the opportunity to meet people
and learn thier experience in teaching part-time.</p>
<h4
id="gateway-course-experience-conference-in-atlanta-march-2019">Gateway
Course Experience Conference in Atlanta, March 2019: </h4>
<p>I was fortunate to attend the 2019 Gateway Course Experience
Conference in Atlanta to meet many teachers and listen to pioneers in
the field of teaching. I have attended several computer science
conferences before but this was a very different experience and I would
certainly like to do it again.</p>
<p>I have put a very sincere effort in improving my teaching,
connecting, and taking feedback from the experts. As I continue my
teaching journey, I am looking forward for more sessions that can make
me a better teacher.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="teaching-a-rewarding-experience">Teaching: A
rewarding experience</h3>
<p>I take pride in my positive course evaluations and it is not
accidental. I listened to my students and I try to see the situation
from their point of view. This has always helped me. Let me give an
example, a student can wait for a reply from their teacher for a few
hours or so usually, however, the same student who has a grade
correction before submitting the final grade will need a response in
minutes. As a teacher, I need to understand and make sure the students
have enough time to review the grades before the final grade submission
or make myself available during those critical hours for questions. . I
get motivated to teach from the 1-2 line introduction they give me
during the beginning of the course to the few “thank you” notes or
messages at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>I am so glad that I get to improve my teaching and help students at
KSU with my part-time teaching job.</p>
