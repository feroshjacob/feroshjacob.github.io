<p>I consider teaching both a challenging and exciting profession. From a technical perspective, teaching can be defined as a three-step cyclical process. First, a teacher is given a subject and a set of students. In the initial step, the teacher engages in background reading and develops excitement about the topic. Next, the teacher conveys that excitement and knowledge to the students. Finally, students expand their knowledge independently and provide feedback to the teacher, who updates their understanding in preparation for the next group of students. The students’ ultimate contribution, which can have a significant impact on the world, heavily depends on the teacher’s ability to engage and inspire them. While it can be difficult to cultivate and transmit this excitement, it is not impossible. My approach to this challenge is guided by two key questions: <strong>What to teach?</strong> and <strong>How to teach?</strong></p>

<b>What to Teach</b>
<p>As an instructor, I focus on teaching fundamentals rather than transient technologies. It is important to identify the high-level goals of a course. For example, a student completing a compiler construction course with me should:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Develop curiosity to explore programming languages beyond the classroom examples.</li>
    <li>Gain confidence in implementing algorithms in any language, given the grammar of that language.</li>
    <li>Understand programming languages as tools for implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>After defining these goals, I structure course material to introduce these concepts in an orderly manner while keeping the overall picture clear for students.</p>

<b>How to Teach</b>
<p>Teaching methods should be flexible, evolving based on the students, course content, and learning environment. For instance, to engage struggling or bored students, assignments and assessments may include both basic and challenging tasks, with the balance adjusted for each class. I believe a teacher must continually self-evaluate after each class and adapt teaching methods accordingly. Effective teaching is a dynamic process, shaped by mutual understanding between the teacher and the students.</p>

<b>Teaching Philosophy as a Part-Time Faculty</b>
<p>I have taught in departments with strong policies to maintain course standards, including assigned course coordinators who provide learning outcomes, syllabi, and lecture materials. I work closely with coordinators to adapt materials when necessary, ensuring alignment with my teaching philosophy. Support from faculty and department leadership has been essential in enabling this collaboration.</p>

<b>Teaching Experience</b>
<p>My first university-level teaching experience was as an instructor for <strong>Calculus I</strong>. This opportunity helped me understand the three key aspects of classroom teaching: preparation, lecturing, and student assessment. Based on positive student feedback, I was assigned <strong>Calculus II</strong> the following semester.</p>

<p>Since summer 2017, I have taught undergraduate and graduate evening classes while working full-time in industry. Teaching has reinforced the importance of understanding students and how they learn. Some highlights include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>CS 1301 – Programming Principles I:</strong> This gateway course had many freshmen and non-CS majors, with historically high D, F, W, and I rates. I began my lectures by highlighting industry opportunities and demonstrating the relevance of programming through real-world examples. My approach helped reduce failure rates and encouraged students to pursue internships in industry.</li>
    <li><strong>CS 7263 – Text Mining:</strong> This graduate course included both full-time students with limited industry experience and part-time students seeking lighter coursework. To accommodate these diverse groups, I modified assessments to include a major project and short, frequent quizzes. This structure helped part-time students stay on track while allowing full-time students to engage in industry-standard projects collaboratively.</li>
</ul>

<b>Teaching Approach</b>
<p>Throughout my teaching, I strive to transfer my enthusiasm for the subject to my students. I build strong student-teacher relationships by encouraging active participation and maintaining flexible office hours. These efforts have resulted in above-average outcomes and positive student feedback.</p>

<p>I also believe in balancing guidance with independence. Students should be encouraged to explore concepts while receiving mentorship to stay focused and develop responsibility. My goal as a teacher is to show students <em>how</em> to approach problems rather than merely providing solutions. Good teaching invests in students’ growth, which ultimately fosters stronger research and professional contributions.</p>

<b>Professional Development in Teaching</b>
<p>Teaching part-time is more than a secondary income; it is a serious commitment. I actively seek feedback and pursue opportunities to improve my teaching skills. Some highlights include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>CETL Online Course Development Workshop (Jan 2018):</strong> Learned techniques for engaging students through 1-to-many interactions rather than 1-to-1, which I have incorporated into my teaching.</li>
    <li><strong>SPACE Symposium for Part-time, Adjunct, and Contingent Educators (June 2019):</strong> Presented on balancing full-time industry work with part-time teaching, and learned from peers’ experiences.</li>
    <li><strong>Gateway Course Experience Conference (March 2019):</strong> Gained new insights from pioneers in teaching large enrollment courses, which informed my classroom strategies.</li>
</ul>

<b>Teaching as a Rewarding Experience</b>
<p>I take pride in positive course evaluations, which result from understanding students’ perspectives and being responsive to their needs. For instance, I make myself available during critical times, such as final grade submissions, to address student concerns promptly. Witnessing students grow and succeed is highly motivating, and I view teaching as an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to their development.</p>

<p>In summary, teaching allows me to share knowledge, inspire curiosity, and foster student growth. It is a profession in which both students and instructors benefit, and I remain committed to continuously improving my teaching methods to create meaningful learning experiences.</p>
